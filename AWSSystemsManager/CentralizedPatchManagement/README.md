# Operational Management: Inventory, Patching, and Compliance

# Overview

The purpose of this series of AWS CloudFormation templates is to setup a scheduled multi-account and multi-Region (MAMR) patching operation using Amazon EventBridge rules, AWS Lambda, and AWS Systems Manager Automation. Additionally, Systems Manager Inventory is enabled using a State Manager association. The patching, inventory, and compliance data gathered can then be queried and reported on using Amazon Athena or Amazon QuickSight.

# Service Concepts

In this section, we take a closer look at the following concepts of AWS Systems Manager and AWS Glue.

| Service | Term | Definition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AWS Systems Manager | Automation Document | A Systems Manager **automation document**, or playbook, defines the Automation workflow (the actions that Systems Manager performs on your managed instances and AWS resources). Automation includes several pre-defined Automation documents that you can use to perform common tasks like restarting one or more Amazon EC2 instances or creating an Amazon Machine Image (AMI). You can create your own Automation documents as well. Documents use JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) or YAML, and they include steps and parameters that you specify. For more information, see [Working with Automation Documents (Playbooks)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/automation-documents.html). |
| AWS Systems Manager | Automation Administration Role | This role gives the user permission to run Automation workflows in multiple AWS accounts and OUs. You only need to create this role in the Automation management account. We **recommend** not changing the role name as specified in the template to something besides AWS-SystemsManager-AutomationAdministrationRole. Otherwise, your multi-Region and multi-Account Automation workflows might fail. For more information, see [Running Automation Workflows in Multiple AWS Regions and Accounts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-automation-multiple-accounts-and-regions.html). |
| AWS Systems Manager | Automation Execution Role | This role gives Systems Manager permission to perform actions on your behalf. You must create this role in every account that you want to target to run multi-Region and multi-account Automations. We **recommend** not changing the role name as specified in the template to something besides AWS-SystemsManager-AutomationExecutionRole. Otherwise, your multi-Region and multi-Account Automation workflows might fail. For more information, see [Running Automation Workflows in Multiple AWS Regions and Accounts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-automation-multiple-accounts-and-regions.html). |
| AWS Systems Manager | Resource Data Sync | You can use Systems Manager **resource data sync** to send inventory data collected from all of your managed instances to a single Amazon S3 bucket. Resource data sync then automatically updates the centralized data when new inventory data is collected. For more information, see [Configuring Resource Data Sync for Inventory](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/sysman-inventory-datasync.html). |
| AWS Systems Manager | Patch Baseline | A **patch baseline** defines which patches are approved for installation on your instances. You can specify approved or rejected patches one by one. You can also create auto-approval rules to specify that certain types of updates (for example, critical updates) should be automatically approved. The rejected list overrides both the rules and the approve list. For more information, see [About Predefined and Custom Patch Baselines](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/sysman-patch-baselines.html) |
| AWS Systems Manager | Patch Group | You can use a **patch group** to associate instances with a specific patch baseline. Patch groups help ensure that you are deploying the appropriate patches, based on the associated patch baseline rules, to the correct set of instances. Patch groups can also help you avoid deploying patches before they have been adequately tested. For example, you can create patch groups for different environments (such as Development, Test, and Production) and register each patch group to an appropriate patch baseline. **Note**: A managed instance can only be in one patch group. You create a patch group by using Amazon EC2 tags or Systems Manager resource tags. Unlike other tagging scenarios across Systems Manager, a patch group **must** be defined with the tag key: **Patch Group**. Note that the key is case-sensitive. You can specify any value, for example ```web servers``` but the key must be **Patch Group**.For more information, see [About Patch Groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/sysman-patch-patchgroups.html). |
| AWS Systems Manager | Activation Code | To set up servers and virtual machines (VMs) in your hybrid environment as managed instances, you need to create a managed-instance **activation**. After you successfully complete the activation, you immediately receive an **Activation Code** and **Activation ID**. You specify this Code/ID combination when you install SSM Agent on servers and VMs in your hybrid environment. The Code/ID provides secure access to the Systems Manager service from your managed instances. For more information, see [Setting Up AWS Systems Manager for Hybrid Environments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-managedinstances.html). |
| AWS Glue | Crawler | A **crawler** accesses your data store, extracts metadata, and creates table definitions in the AWS Glue Data Catalog.For more information, see [Working with Crawlers on the AWS Glue Console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/console-crawlers.html). |

# Architecture Diagram

## Resulting Environment

After deploying the provided CloudFormation templates in the central account and target account(s), you will have a scheduled CloudWatch Event. The CloudWatch Event will then invoke a Lambda function to call a multi-account and multi-region Automation operation for patching managed instances using the Command document ```AWS-RunPatchBaseline```. After the first execution of the CloudWatch Event (based on the schedule provided), patching and the resulting patch compliance data will be available for your targeted managed instances. An alternative to an EventBridge rule, you can use a [Systems Manager Maintenance Window](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-maintenance.html) as the scheduling mechanism for the multi-account patching operation.

The default option for the patching operation is to scan for missing updates. You can optionally choose the ```Install``` operation when deploying the CloudFormation template which will scan and install any missing updates on the target managed instances. During the patching operation, the managed instance will scan (or install) patches based on the patch baseline approval rules. For more information, see [About Predefined and Custom Patch Baselines](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/sysman-patch-baselines.html) and [About Patch Groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/sysman-patch-patchgroups.html). To create a custom patch baseline, see [Create a Custom Patch Baseline](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/sysman-patch-baseline-console.html).

Additionally, a State Manager Association will be created to gather software inventory data (applications installed, AWS components, network configuration, etc.). Compliance data will be reported based on the success of gathering of inventory data (Compliant if the operation completed successfully or non-compliant if the resource did not gather inventory successfully).

The patching data, inventory data, and resulting compliance data will then be exported to the centralized S3 bucket via a Resource Data Sync created in each target account. You can then use AWS Glue, Amazon Athena, and Amazon QuickSight to report and visualize this data across your environment.

### (Optional) Patch Microsoft Applications

_Note: If you do not intend on patching Microsoft Applications (e.g. Microsoft Office, Microsoft Active Directory, or Microsoft SQL) then you can skip this section._

You can configure Patch Baselines to select and apply Microsoft application patches automatically across your Amazon EC2 or on-premises instances. All application patches available in the Microsoft update catalog are supported. For more information, see [About Patching Applications on Windows Server](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/about-windows-app-patching.html).

**Important**: Microsoft application patching is available at no additional charge for EC2 instances and incurs a charge as part of the On-Premises Instance Management advanced tier when used on premises; see the [pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/pricing/) for details.

## Architecture Workflow

### Patching Process

1. CloudWatch Event triggers based on schedule.
2. CloudWatch Event rule initiates the Lambda function to call the Automation API ```StartAutomationExecution``` against the targeted accounts and regions.
3. The Automation workflow is initiated in each target account and region.
4. The workflow initiates the Run Command document ```AWS-RunPatchBaseline``` with the operation specified.
5. Results from the Run Command task are outputted to the centralized S3 bucket.
6. Patch Compliance data is reported to Patch Manager.
7. The Resource Data Sync takes the Patch Compliance data and outputs to the centralized S3 bucket.

### Inventory Data Gathering Process

1. The State Manager Association triggers using the rate of 1 day to gather software inventory data.
2. The Inventory data is reported to Systems Manager.
3. The Resource Data Sync takes the Inventory data and outputs to the centralized S3 bucket.

## Architecture Notes

- The Inventory execution logs will be segmented by account ID and region. For example:

```ssm-execution-logs-us-east-1-123456789012/inventory-execution-logs/accountid=123456789012/region=us-east-1/i-1234567890EXAMPLE/.../stdout```

- The full output results of the ```AWS-RunPatchBaseline``` operation can be located in the central S3 bucket under the prefix patching. This is then segmented by account ID and region. For example:

```ssm-execution-logs-us-east-1-123456789012/patching/accountid=123456789012/region=us-east-1/executionid={{automation:EXECUTION_ID}}/<run-command-id>…/stdout```

- The State Manager Association for ```AWS-GatherSoftwareInventory``` is configured to run once a day and gathers the default Inventory parameters. For more information, see [Metadata Collected by Inventory](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/sysman-inventory-schema.html).

- The Glue Crawler is configured to run once a day at 00:00 UTC.

# Pre-Requisites

Register your EC2 instance or on-premise hybrid instances. For more information, see [Setting Up AWS Systems Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-setting-up.html) and [Setting Up AWS Systems Manager for Hybrid Environments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-managedinstances.html).

## Expectations

1. If applicable, you have registered your on-premise VMs and servers to Systems Manager. For more information, see [Setting Up AWS Systems Manager for Hybrid Environments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-managedinstances.html).

1. For your EC2 instances or if you are using hybrid managed instances (```mi-*```), then you must grant S3 permissions to the central S3 bucket in order to export patching and Inventory execution logs. For more information, see [Step 2: Create an IAM Service Role for a Hybrid Environment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/sysman-service-role.html).

    An example IAM policy snippet is as follows (you must replace the S3 ARN with the ARN of the S3 bucket created by the Central account CFN template):

    ```json
    {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": [
            "s3:GetObject",
            "s3:PutObject",
            "s3:PutObjectAcl"
        ],
        "Resource": [
            "arn:aws:s3:::ssm-execution-logs-us-east-1-123456789012",
            "arn:aws:s3:::ssm-execution-logs-us-east-1-123456789012/*"
        ]
    }
    ```

1. You create patch baselines with the appropriate approval rules and exceptions. For more information, see [About Predefined and Custom Patch Baselines](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/sysman-patch-baselines.html). To create a custom patch baseline, see [Create a Custom Patch Baseline](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/sysman-patch-baseline-console.html).

1. The Automation runbook targets Systems Manager managed instances using Resource Groups. To scan for missing patches or install updates on your managed instances, the resources must be in the targeted Resource Group. For more information, see [Build a Query and Create a Group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ARG/latest/userguide/gettingstarted-query.html#gettingstarted-query-console) in the _AWS Resource Groups User Guide_. Please note, the Resource Group must have the exact same name in all target account(s).

## Limitations

### Targeting Limitations
- You can only target one Resource Group.
- Multi-account and multi-Region Automation can target AWS Account IDs or AWS Organization OU IDs. If you want to target Organization OU IDs, then the central account CloudFormation stack must be either (1) created within the root Organizations account or (2) created within an account specified as the Delegated Administrator account. An account can be specified as a Delegated Administrator account within the Systems Manager Explorer settings, for more information see [Configuring a Delegated Administrator](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/Explorer-setup-delegated-administrator.html).
   - When targeting using Organization OU IDs, you must target the OU which contains AWS accounts IDs directly. You cannot specify an OU which contains further nested OUs. For example, in the following screenshot you can see a simple Organization tree where the ```DEV``` OU contains a single account. When calling a multi-account/multi-Region Automation workflow, you must target the ```DEV``` OU and cannot target parent OUs, such as ```Workloads``` or ```Root```.
   ![](images/opsmgmt-orgtree.png)
- To target resource tags instead of Resource Groups, you must modify the Automation document in the CloudFormation template, ```opsmgmt-operations-central-account.yaml```. An example modification is as follows:

```
  Targets:
  - Key: 'tag:Name'
    Values:
      - !Ref TagValue
```

1. Choose **Create stack**.

Repeat the above process to deploy instances to multiple accounts and Regions. **Important:** If you deploy to multiple regions within the same account, then you must provide IAM Instance Profile value for **ExistingManagedInstanceProfile**.

# Post-Deployment Instructions

## Run the AWS Glue Crawler

**Note**: Inventory data is gathered immediately for matching managed instances. Patch data (and the resulting compliance data specific to patching) will be gathered following the first invocation of the CloudWatch Event which is based on the schedule specified when creating the CloudFormation stack.

The AWS Glue Crawler is configured to run once a day. The first run will occur on the next occurence of 00:00 UTC following the creation of the CloudFormation stack. If you would like to review data within Athena prior to this time, you must manually run the Glue Crawler.

1. In the central account, open the [AWS Glue console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/glue/home).
1. Select **Crawlers** in the left-hand navigation pane.
1. Select the Glue Crawler created by the Central CloudFormation template. The name is ```SSM-GlueCrawler```
1. Select **Run crawler**.

The Crawler should run for approximately 2-4 minutes before stopping. Once the Crawler has returned to the ```Ready``` state, verify that tables were added to the resulting database. 

**Note**: 14 tables are added following successful patch scanning (or installing) process and Inventory data gathering process. If your CloudWatch Event rule has not executed yet, then you may have fewer tables added. Following a patching operation and the next execution of the Crawler, additional tables will be created automatically.

### (Optional) Verify the Database and Tables within AWS Glue

Following the successful run of the Crawler in the previous section, you can optionally choose to review the database and tables created.

1. In the central account, open the [AWS Glue console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/glue/home).
1. Select **Databases**, in the left-hand navigation pane.
1. Select the database created by the Crawler. The name should be similar to:
   
   ```ssm_global_resource_sync```
1. Select the option to review the tables for this specific database. The link is similar to the following:
   
   ```Tables in ssm_global_resource_sync```
1. Optionally, select a table to review additional details, such as the table properties, schema, and partitions.


## Use AWS Athena to query Inventory, Patching, and Compliance data

1. In the Central Account, open the [AWS Athena console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/athena/home).
1. Select **Saved Queries**.
1. Select the named query that you want to run.
   - **QueryNonCompliantPatch** - List managed instances that are non-compliant for patching.
   - **QuerySSMAgentVersion** - List SSM Agent versions installed on managed instances.
   - **QueryInstanceList** - List non-terminated instances.
   - **QueryInstanceApplications** - List applications for non-terminated instances.
1. After selecting a named query, ensure the ```ssm_global_resource_sync``` databse is selected.
1. Next, select **Run query** and view the results.
1. Optionally, select the **History** tab and select **Download results** to receive a CSV formatted output of the results.

# Tear-Down Instructions

## Remove resources from the Target Account(s)

1. In each Target account, open the [CloudFormation console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/).
